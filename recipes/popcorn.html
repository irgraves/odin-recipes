    <h3>You may be asking yourself "Isn't corn yellow?" <strong>Not anymore!</strong></h3>
    <p>Since the dawn of time, corn has been thought of as yellow, but if you add 
        some oil to it, it gets <em>fluffy</em> and <em>white</em>. Add some other stuff and
        you have a gourmet feast!
